Currency Converter (Java GUI)
Overview
The Currency Converter is a Java-based application that allows users to convert an amount from one currency to another using real-time exchange rates. The application provides a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) built with JavaFX, where users can select the base currency and the target currency, input the amount to convert, and view the result instantly. Exchange rates are fetched in real-time from a reliable API to ensure the conversions are accurate.

This project demonstrates how to interact with external APIs, handle JSON data, and perform currency conversions within a Java-based application with a clean, interactive user interface.
